# network-security

A few short scripts written and submitted when taking CS4760 (network security) in Python using mainly the socket and cryptography libraries.

# Notes
- Some files require private/public key pairs or certificates to be generated and provided for functionality which were both omitted
    1. comments and source code indicates which files require keys, certificates, or both
    2. OpenSSL provides ways to generate such keys or certificates
- Code builds off and completes some of Professor Daniel Graham's problems in his book/guide, "Ethical Hacking: A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In"
